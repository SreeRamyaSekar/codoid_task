    <h1>ONLINE BANKING</h1>
    <p>Online banking, also known as internet banking or e-banking, refers to a set of financial services that are available through the internet or a mobile app. Online banking allows customers to perform various banking transactions and services without physically visiting a bank branch.</p>
    <p>Typical online banking services include account management, fund transfers, bill payments, loan applications, and online statements. Online banking services are available 24/7, which makes it convenient for customers to manage their finances at any time from any location.</p>
    <p>Online banking is also a cost-effective way for banks to offer their services. It reduces the need for bank branches and employees, as most transactions can be done electronically. This translates into cost savings for banks, which they can pass on to their customers in the form of lower fees and better interest rates.</p>
    <p>Online banking has become increasingly popular over the years, especially with the rise of smartphones and mobile devices. Many banks now offer mobile apps that allow customers to perform banking transactions on the go. The security of online banking has also improved, with banks using various measures such as two-factor authentication and encryption to protect their customers' information.</p>
